                                            Avengers: Infinity War is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel
                                            Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and
                                            distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to The
                                            Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and the 19th film in the
                                            Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and
                                            written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an
                                            ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo,
                                            Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom
                                            Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie,
                                            Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldaña,
                                            Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In the film, the Avengers and the Guardians of
                                            the Galaxy attempt to prevent Thanos from collecting the six all-powerful
                                            Infinity Stones as part of his quest to kill half of all life in the
                                            universe.

                                            The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1.
                                            The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015, and a month later
                                            Markus and McFeely signed on to write the script for the film, which draws
                                            inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 comic book The Infinity Gauntlet and
                                            Jonathan Hickman's 2013 comic book Infinity. In 2016, Marvel shortened the
                                            title to Avengers: Infinity War. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood
                                            Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast consisting
                                            mostly of actors reprising their roles from previous MCU films, including
                                            Brolin as Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017, shooting
                                            back-to-back with a direct sequel, Avengers: Endgame (2019). Additional
                                            filming took place in Scotland, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York
                                            City. With an estimated budget of $325–400 million, the film is one of the
                                            most expensive films ever made.

                                            Avengers: Infinity War premiered in Los Angeles on April 23, 2018, and was
                                            released in the United States on April 27, as part of Phase Three of the
                                            MCU. The film received praise for Brolin's performance, visual effects,
                                            action sequences, and emotional weight. The film was the fourth film and the
                                            first superhero film to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous
                                            box office records, and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2018 and the
                                            fourth-highest-grossing film of all time both worldwide and in the United
                                            States and Canada. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the
                                            91st Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. The sequel, Avengers:
                                            Endgame, was released in April 2019.

                                            Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom

                                            the Galaxy attempt to prevent Thanos from collecting the six all-powerful
                                            Infinity Stones as part of his quest to kill half of all life in the
                                            universe.

                                            The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1.
                                            The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015, and a month later
                                            Markus and McFeely signed on to write the script for the film, which draws
                                            inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 comic book The Infinity Gauntlet and
                                            Jonathan Hickman's 2013 comic book Infinity. In 2016, Marvel shortened the
                                            title to Avengers: Infinity War. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood
                                            Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast consisting
                                            mostly of actors reprising their roles from previous MCU films, including
                                            Brolin as Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017, shooting
                                            back-to-back with a direct sequel, Avengers: Endgame (2019). Additional
                                            filming took place in Scotland, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York
                                            City. With an estimated budget of $325–400 million, the film is one of the
                                            most expensive films ever made.

                                            Avengers: Infinity War premiered in Los Angeles on April 23, 2018, and was
                                            released in the United States on April 27, as part of Phase Three of the
                                            MCU. The film received praise for Brolin's performance, visual effects,
                                            action sequences, and emotional weight. The film was the fourth film and the
                                            first superhero film to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous
                                            box office records, and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2018 and the
                                            fourth-highest-grossing film of all time both worldwide and in the United
                                            States and Canada. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the
                                            91st Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. The sequel, Avengers:
                                            Endgame, was released in April 2019.
